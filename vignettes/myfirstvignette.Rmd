This is my personal package that provides the following capabilities:

1. `pv`: Computes present value
2. `rescale`: Rescales numeric vectors
3. `psc`: Includes an example data set

## Present value

The `pv` function computes the present value based on a specified future value, interest rate, and number of time periods. For example, given you have future values ranging from 1000-3000, you can compute the different present values for a 5% interest rate and a 5 year time period with:

```{r}
library(myfirstpackage)

pv(c(1000, 2000, 3000), r = .05, n = 5)
```
